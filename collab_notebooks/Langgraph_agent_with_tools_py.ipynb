            "\n",
            "1. **Data Skew Mitigation**:\n",
            "   - **Salting**: Add a random prefix to keys to distribute data more evenly across partitions.\n",
            "   - **Increase Parallelism**: Increase the number of partitions to better distribute the data load.\n",
            "   - **Custom Partitioning**: Use a custom partitioner to control how data is distributed across partitions.\n",

            "   - **Sample Data**: Analyze a sample of the data to understand the distribution and identify skewed keys.\n",

            "   - **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Enable dynamic allocation of resources to handle varying loads during job execution.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Optimize Data Storage**: Use efficient data formats like Parquet or ORC, which are optimized for Spark processing. These formats support columnar storage and compression, reducing I/O operations.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "3. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure that your Spark job has adequate resources. This includes setting the right number of executors, cores, and memory. Over-provisioning can also lead to inefficiencies, so balance is key.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Optimize Spark Configurations**: Tweak Spark configurations such as `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`, `spark.executor.memory`, and `spark.executor.cores` to match your workload requirements.\n",

            "5. **Use Caching**: Cache intermediate data when it is reused multiple times in your job. This avoids recomputation and speeds up processing.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Optimize Transformations**: Use narrow transformations (like `map` and `filter`) instead of wide transformations (like `groupByKey`) when possible, as they are more efficient.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Broadcast Joins**: For small datasets, use broadcast joins to avoid the overhead of shuffling large datasets across the cluster.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Avoid Skew**: Ensure that your data is evenly distributed across partitions to avoid skew, which can lead to some tasks taking significantly longer than others.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Code Optimization**: Review and optimize your Spark code. Avoid using UDFs if possible, as they can be slower than native Spark functions.\n",

            "1. **Mutability**: \n",
            "   - **Lists** are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after the list has been created.\n",

            "   - **Lists** are defined using square brackets, e.g., `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`.\n",
            "   - **Tuples** are defined using parentheses, e.g., `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`.\n",

            "   - **Lists** are generally used when you need a collection of items that may need to be changed or updated.\n",
            "   - **Tuples** are used when you want to ensure the data remains constant throughout the program, or when using them as keys in dictionaries.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Methods**:\n",
            "   - **Lists** have several built-in methods like `append()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`.\n",
